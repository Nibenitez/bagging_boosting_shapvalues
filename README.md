# bagging_boosting_shapvalues
Bagging and boosting techniques aplication to predict property sales and rental values. Use of SHAP Values.

This project focuses on the application of bagging and boosting techniques to predict Barcelona property sales and rental values. Additionally, it utilizes SHAP values for interpretability and feature importance analysis. The project is implemented in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
Two datasets are used in this project:

processed_renting_Barcelona.csv: This dataset contains processed information about rental properties in Barcelona, including various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and rental value.

processed_sale_Barcelona.csv: This dataset contains processed information about properties available for sale in Barcelona, including features such as location, size, number of rooms, and sale value.

Files Included
Bagging_Boosting_ShapValues_Notebook.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the source code for applying bagging and boosting techniques to predict property values. It also demonstrates the utilization of SHAP values for interpretability and feature analysis.

processed_renting_Barcelona.csv: The dataset file for rental properties in Barcelona.

processed_sale_Barcelona.csv: The dataset file for properties available for sale in Barcelona.

README.md: This file.

Instructions
To run the project, please follow these steps:

Download the necessary files from the repository to your local machine.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Open the Bagging_Boosting_ShapValues_Notebook.ipynb notebook.

Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, etc. You can install them using the command !pip install [library name] if needed.

Load the datasets processed_renting_Barcelona.csv and processed_sale_Barcelona.csv into the notebook.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and perform bagging and boosting techniques for property value prediction. Additionally, analyze the SHAP values for interpretability and feature importance.

The notebook will generate visualizations and insights regarding property value predictions and feature importance.

Notes
The bagging and boosting techniques implemented in this project aim to improve the accuracy of property value predictions using ensemble methods.

The utilization of SHAP values provides a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process and the impact of each feature on the predictions.
